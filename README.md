<b>Idea</b>: Telemedicine Web Application<br>

<b>Project Name</b>: FastDoc<br>

<b>DISCLAIMER (PLEASE READ BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO ACCESS THE FASTDOC WEBSITE)</b>
<br>
- Certain features may not work without running the NodeJS server side code as well, this can be done by clicking on the file named 'start_server.bat' located in the main directory of this project (the same directory in which the file named 'index.html' is located in). Please ensure that you click and run the 'start_server.bat' from this directory path to prevent any issues from arising during the process.

- Note: You will need to have NodeJS installed on your system/device as the server side code relies on NodeJS.

- Mandatory steps to take to ensure that the website runs with all features working:<br>
    1. Run the 'start_server.bat' from the same directory that it was located in (the project's main directory).
    1. Open your browser.
    1. Type in the following address in your browser's search bar: http://localhost:8080/
    1. You have now been directed to the FastDoc website successfully. If your browser shows an error saying: 'This site canâ€™t be reached', please check that the start_server.bat batch script is still running, it needs to be running while you are using the website.
    1. Once you are done using the website and you would like to stop the batch script from running, go to the command line and just press and hold the Ctrl key and then press the C key, this should end the script.
