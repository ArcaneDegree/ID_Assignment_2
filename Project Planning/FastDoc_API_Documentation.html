        <h2>How do member account privilege types work in FastDoc:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Each member account on FastDoc is assigned a privilege type. There are 4 different
                privilege types at the current time of writing.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Guest
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        NormalMember
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Doctor
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Administrator
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                The Guest privilege type is currently not in use. It was initially intended to
                identify users who were not logged in to any account so as to provide the
                correct set of features meant for guests to them.
            </li>
            <li>
                The NormalMember privilege type is assigned to an account that has been created
                through the "Sign Up" page of the website.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Doctor and Administrator privilege types are not and cannot be assigned to
                accounts created through the "Sign Up" page of the website. Instead, the head
                administrator of the website will perform the creation of these accounts when the
                new doctor or administrator has joined FastDoc as part of the
                standard onboarding procedure for new employees, the credentials of the newly
                created account will then be sent privately to the new employee. If the new
                employee is a doctor, their account will be assigned the Doctor privilege type,
                otherwise, if the new employee is an administrator, their account will be assigned
                the Administrator privilege type.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Possible security related loopholes or edge cases concerning the FastDoc API</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A user could modify code in the 'fastdoc_api.js' file to modify the implementation
                of the AddNewMember function to assign a privilege type of Doctor or Administrator
                to their own account just before clicking on the submit button on the Sign Up form.
                Chrome browsers allow users to not just view code, but also modify the code. This
                would end up allowing their elevate their permissions on the website without
                authorization.

        <h2>IRIR (Information request -> Redirect Information request -> Redirect request) method</h2>
        <h3>Main procedure</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The client wants to go to another page. They need to send information A1 in the
                request when sending a request to go to another page to the server.
            </li>
            <li>
                The client requests information A1 from the server.
            </li>
            <li>
                The server sends back information A1 with a signature to the client.
            </li>
            <li>
                The client requests a page link, they are required to send information A1 along with
                the signature.
            </li>
            <li>
                The server first checks the signature in the client's request to verify that
                information A1 has not been changed. If it has been changed, the server returns an
                error message, otherwise, the server checks information A1 to see if the client is
                allowed to view the page at the link being requested. If the client is not allowed
                to view the page, an error message is returned, otherwise, the link to the page is
                sent, the link comprises of the HTML file name and a server encrypted version of
                information A1.
            </li>
            <li>
                The client uses the link received from the server to redirect to the desired page.
            </li>
            <li>
                The browser sends a request for the page resource to the server.
            </li>
            <li>
                The server looks at the URL path of the request (which comprises of the HTML file name
                of the requested page resource and the server encrypted version of information A1). It
                decrypts the encrypted version of information A1, using the information provided in
                information A1, it sees if the client is allowed to view the page. If the client is
                allowed to view the page, the server responds with the relevant page resource, otherwise
                it responds with an error message.
            </li>
            <li>
                Note: Information A1 refers to information that lets the server know if it should
                grant access to a page resource to a user or not.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Proposed measures to secure the website</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Make use of JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) signed with a special key only visible to the server
                to identify users and prevent tampering of token information using a server issued
                signature (the signature is generated on the server only and is used by the server
                to verify the integrity of information in the token).
            </li>
            <li>
                Make use of the IRIR method for handling requests for page redirects.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implementations of procedures dealing with sensitive or protected user information
                (e.g. credentials, user account privilege types etc) should be on the server and not
                on the client.
            </li>
            <li>
                Validation of inputs should be performed mainly on the server side.
            </li>
        </ul>
